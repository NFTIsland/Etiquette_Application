#### :ticket: Ticket System Using NFT for Fair and Transparent Transactions

### :mega: Purpose of planning this project
:arrow_forward: There is a need for a system to resolve consumers' complaints about ticket refund fees and to prevent fraudulent damage that may occur during transactions by presenting transparency in transaction details.  
:arrow_forward: By more clearly guaranteeing the ownership of tickets, it aims to establish a trading platform that can efficiently solve problems occurring in the current ticket trading market.

:arrow_forward: The database is constructed by separately setting additional tables for performing major functions such as auctions, focusing on the 'users' table that stores user information and the 'tickets' table that stores ticket information.

This project is the result of the 2022 Hanium Mentoring Contest.
